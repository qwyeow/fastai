#### Projects using fastai library


[Singapore Rare Birds Classifier](https://github.com/qwyeow/FastAI/blob/master/Singapore_Rare_Birds_Classifier-Prototype.ipynb): a prototype classifier that identifies 10 rare birds seen in Singapore, with close to 90% accuracy, using the techniques from fastai v3 course. Images are downloaded using Google Image Search. The webapp is deployed here [https://sgrarebird-gr0o.app.render.com/](https://sgrarebird-gr0o.app.render.com/)

[102 Flower Species Classifier](https://github.com/qwyeow/FastAI/blob/master/Kaggle_102_Flowers_Diff_Species.ipynb): an image classifier that identifies 102 flower species 3.78% error rate, using Kaggle Dataset
